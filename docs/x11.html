                             **LSON: Lucid Serialized Object Notation**
                                        v0.1.2 / 2019-08-05



Overview
====================================================================================================
LSON is a data representation that aims for simplicity and expressiveness of JSON, but differs
in the following ways:

  + It's intended to be both concise and readable by humans as well as computers. It supports
    comments. Items are optionally terminated by whitespace, end delimiters, commas, or semi-colons.

  + It does not aim to mirror JavaScript, and thus is not a JavaScript subset. At the same time,
    LSON is a superset of JSON: any legal JSON file is legal LSON.

  + LSON is focused on data _representation_, not data _usage_. With the single exception of string
    values, there is no intrinsic support for numbers, boolean, or any other primitive type.

  + LSON supports arbitrary _elements_: domain-specific data values with declared or unknown type.
    Elements provide support for arbitrary domain-specific values, such as `true`, `null`,
    `infinity`, `2018-07-02`, `#6b17ec`, `0x1138`, `(x,a,b) => { a &lt;= x && x &lt;= b }` and so
    forth. LSON encoders and decoders handle both known and unknown types in a consistent and
    predictable manner.

  + LSON supports four intrinsic data structures:
    - array
    - dictionary (a set of name-value pairs)
    - table
    - graph
