Overview
====================================================================================================
LSON is a data representation that aims for simplicity and expressiveness of JSON, but differs
in the following ways:

  - It's intended to be both concise and readable by humans as well as computers. It supports
    comments. Items are optionally terminated by whitespace, end delimiters, commas, or semi-colons.

  - It does not aim to mirror JavaScript, and thus is not a JavaScript subset. At the same time,
    LSON is a superset of JSON: any legal JSON file is legal LSON.

  - LSON is focused on data _representation_, not data _usage_. With the single exception of string
    values, there is no intrinsic support for numbers, boolean, or any other primitive type.

  - LSON supports four intrinsic data structures:
    - array
    - dictionary (a set of name-value pairs)
    - table
    - graph
