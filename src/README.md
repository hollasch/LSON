LSON C++ Utility
====================================================================================================

This is the C++ utility library and command-line utility for [LSON][]. It's in very rough form at
this point. At this time, I'm just using Visual Studio `nmake` to build the all-in-one utility. With
Visual Studio's `nmake` on your command path, just run `nmake` on the command line in the `src`
directory to build.

More to come.
